I tested this project on:
-Macintosh LC (works without problems), Macintosh IIsi (works without problems), PowerBook 145B (works with a 5V 3A PSU attached to the STM32's USB port, Power Macintosh/Performa 6200 (doesn't work, Mac get stuck into the grey boot screen), Power Macintosh 6500/275 (doesn't work, Mac get stuck into the grey boot screen, sometimes it boots to Mac OS 8.6 but get stuck during boot)

Tested MacOS versions:6.0.7, 7.0.1, 7.1.2, 7.5.3

I'm not a programmer and I don't know anymore how to program, I only tested this project on Apple computers.
