# ArdSCSino-stm32 [Personal files from MrGasS]

Files and folders with [GAS] are mine.

Here I'm including only corrected gerber files for PCBs printing, hex files compiled from source code for lazy guys, Hardfiles to use this project on 68k Macs and other personal sh*t.

I tested this project on:
-Macintosh LC (works without problems), Macintosh IIsi (works without problems), PowerBook 145B (works with a 5V 3A PSU attached to the STM32's USB port), Quadra 700 (get stuck after booting MacOS, but works perfectly when loading MacOS from floppy, I have to investigate), Power Macintosh/Performa 6200 (doesn't work, Mac get stuck into the grey boot screen), Power Macintosh 6500/275 (doesn't work, Mac get stuck into the grey boot screen, sometimes it boots to Mac OS 8.6 but get stuck during boot)

Tested MacOS versions: 6.0.7, 7.0.1, 7.1.2, 7.5.3

I'm not a programmer and I don't know anymore how to program, I only tested this project on Apple computers.
