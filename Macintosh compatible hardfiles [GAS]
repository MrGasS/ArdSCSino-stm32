Here I'm storing pre-formatted images for Macintosh computers.
I created these images with my SCSI2SD because the Macintosh doesn't like formatting the ArdSCSIno.

for 1 GB image -> 2 GB SD | for 2 GB image -> 4 GB SD | for 4 GB image -> 8 GB SD

Good news for you: you can install MacOS with BasiliskII onto the image then copy it to an SD card :)
