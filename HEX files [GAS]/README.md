Here I host my .hex files compiled from source.

Since the ArdSCSIno wants the ID defined in source code, I'll create .hex files for every SCSI ID.

You can flash these files with the STM's Flasher (aka Demonstrator GUI)

P.S: I'M TESTING THESE HEX ONLY ON MACINTOSH COMPUTERS!

release26-1-2019 = old experimental HEX files

ardscsino14-3-19fromNov18sourceNOPARITY = old experimental HEX files, in my Macs the ArdSCSino rarely works into the internal SCSI port, it works good with the external DB25 port
